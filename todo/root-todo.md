## Overall Todo:

* Structure Changes:

    * Change the size of header. It looks kinda big.
    * Make header look more better.
    * There's no border around "Home" tab in header in any of the pages.
    * color change of footer links on hover.
    * Make an error page for everything to be displayed there.

* Themes Changes:

    * Add more themes.
    * Import & replace this purple theme with portofilio's one.

* Homepage:

    * Change the design of Homepage.
    * "Know more about AttendSmart" section change.
    * The black text over the wallpaper? Nah!

* Support:

    * It looks kinda dull too.
    * Change the "Know more about support"
    * Fix the overall design.
    * Put the "Welcome to helpdesk heading" and "Know more..." section in one column, and the content at other.


* LogBook:

    * Try to implement this thing.

* Make sure the sidenav is perfect in all the pages.
