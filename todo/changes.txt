- Implement Leave days for students.

This is the procedure of implementation:
So the process goes like
- A user sends a leave request.
- A teacher accepts it.
- The backend stores the date range, and status of the leave.
- When the teacher takes attendance for his/her subject, other students marks as usual but...
- for the student who's on leave on that day, a teacher gets an option like "Mark for Leave Students" with the discipline options.
- The teacher selects that options, fills the subject Name, and the class he/she is taking attendance for and submits.
- The system scans for the student in the same class, and same subject, and increases their leaveDays to +1
