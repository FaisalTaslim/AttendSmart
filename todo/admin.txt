Perfect, Faisal! That simplifies the Admin Dashboard for now — no live session timers, just **QR-based attendance** control. That still gives us plenty to work with, and you can always upgrade it later.

Here’s how you can **tailor the Admin Dashboard** based on QR-only attendance:

---

### 🎯 **Admin Dashboard Features (QR-Based Attendance Only)**

#### ✅ 1. **Generate QR Code for Attendance**

* Allow admin to generate a **one-time QR code**.
* Options:

  * For a specific **class/department**.
  * For a **particular date/time slot**.
* Can be shown on screen or downloaded as PNG.

> You can generate this QR on server-side using a library like `qrcode` in Node.js.

---

#### ✅ 2. **View Attendance Records**

* See a **table or chart** view of all attendance logs submitted via QR.
* Filters:

  * By class
  * By student
  * By date
* You can show stats like:

  * Total present
  * Total absent
  * No. of entries via QR

---

#### ✅ 3. **Manual Attendance Edit**

* Admin can search and **manually add/edit** entries if a student missed marking via QR.
* Add a **“+ Add Attendance”** or **“Fix Attendance”** button.

---

#### ✅ 4. **User Management**

* Add/Edit/Delete:

  * Teachers
  * Students
  * Other admins
* Assign roles and permissions.

---

#### ✅ 5. **Export Attendance Data**

* Export CSV or Excel reports (daily, monthly, class-wise).
* Helps when colleges or companies want to archive it.

---

#### ✅ 6. **Leave Application Handling** (optional but neat)

* Students can apply for leave if they missed scanning the QR.
* Admin reviews and marks **Approved** or **Rejected**.
* Automatically updates the attendance logs.

### 🧠 Suggested Admin Sidebar Layout (Simple and Neat)

```
- Dashboard
- Generate QR
- Attendance Logs
- Manage Users
- Edit Attendance
- Export Reports
```

You don’t need the live session or timer-based stuff for now. This QR-focused structure keeps things clean and still very practical 💡

If you want help building:

* The route for QR generation
* Attendance log table with filters
* A user-friendly form to edit attendance

...just give me a nudge! 😎
