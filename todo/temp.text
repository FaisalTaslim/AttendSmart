Nice! So you're building the **Corporate Employee Dashboard** — the one-stop control center for all those office warriors in AttendSmart. 💼⚙️

Let’s break it down into **what kind of features would make sense** for corporate employees. This should be *clean, functional, and productivity-focused*. Here's a solid list of what you can include:

---

### 🧠 **Core Dashboard Sections**

#### 1. **Welcome Header**

* “Welcome, \[Name]”
* Role & Department
* Today's Date & Time (use JS for live clock maybe)

---

### 📊 **Attendance Overview**

* **Today’s Status**: Present / Absent / On Leave
* **This Month’s Summary**:

  * Total Working Days
  * Days Present
  * Days Absent
  * Late Entries (if you're tracking time too)

---

### 📝 **Attendance Log**

* Table format

  * **Date**
  * **Status** (Present/Absent/Late/Leave)
  * **Time In / Time Out** *(optional but cool)*
  * **Remarks**

---

### 📅 **Leave Requests**

* **Apply for Leave** form
* **Pending/Approved/Rejected Requests** tracker

---

### 🧾 **Daily Tasks / Worklog**

* Optional section to add:

  * Tasks Completed
  * Notes or Work Summary
  * Time spent on each task *(for tracking productivity)*

---

### 🗂️ **My Profile**

* Name, ID, Department, Designation
* Contact info
* Profile picture (optional, but makes it feel more real)

---

### 🔐 **Account Options**

* Change password
* Logout button
* Notifications (e.g., leave approval, attendance alerts)

---

### 🌐 **Useful Extras**

* Company Announcements / Notices
* Quick links to HR contact, Policies, Guidelines
* Feedback form

---

### Bonus Cool Add-ons (optional but powerful):

* **Live Clock-in/Clock-out System** (if your system uses real-time attendance)
* **QR-based Check-in** (for mobile-friendly experience later)
* **Export Attendance to PDF / Excel**
* **Dark Mode Toggle** 😎
